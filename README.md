### ‚âß‚ùÄ‚Äø‚ùÄ‚â¶ Inspiration & Design:
_A brief summary_
<br />

<p>
As a specialized interpreter, Miki has interpreted for many patients, regardless of their age and social status, and discovered that they tend to forget their medications names and/or measurement names and numbers. Often times, the numbers are just too many and the terminologies are so lengthy and technical that no wonder why no one remembers anything on top of everything the patients have had to go through. 
<br />
More importantly, as a daughter to aging parents, Miki has noticed that her parents have a propensity to miss dosages of their medications. Miki's parents are not as tech-savvy and would tune out any instructions on how to set up a system to remember when to take what as soon as they hear any technology-like word.
  
<br /> <br />
Too frustrating of a situation together with her hope that her parents would utilize the application developed by their own daughter, has inspired Miki to develop the BearPill Diary application to facilitate individuals in their health-record-management journey.
<br />
The application, however, is much more than just a journal. BearPill Diary can provide users with many useful functionalities, e.g. setting reminders and generating insights about their data. As an illustration, the application can provide users information about their medications, entailing warnings and other patients' experiencing while taking the drugs from openFDA - an Elasticsearch-based API that serves public FDA data about nouns like drugs, devices, and foods.
  
<br /> <br />
Noteworthily, the We-Bare-Bears-inspired design, whose images are acquired from Shutter Stock, was ultimately derived from the idea of spreading positivity through cuteness coupled with the website's mission statement - "Bear it together, Better together."
